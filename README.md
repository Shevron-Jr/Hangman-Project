### Project Description

This is a simple hangman game. It was written in Python, without any libraries or APIs. 
To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. 

If you guess incorrectly 7 times, you "lose". 
If you guess the word before that happens, you "win". 
After you win or lose, you can restart the game by running your terminal again.

##### Enjoy!
